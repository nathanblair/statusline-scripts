# statusline-scripts
A collection of my statusline scripts used in (for now) i3blocks

**Requires use of FontAwesome glyphs**

**But no other tools necessary (no acpi, brightnessctl, mixer, etc.)**

## Includes
- battery
- volume
- brightness

**Screenshot to come!**

## Notes
- Please see the [Arch Wiki on Backlights](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight) to learn how to enable udev rules for your user account so that you can send the appropriate commands to the appropriate file
